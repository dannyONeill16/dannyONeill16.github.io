                <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif ;"> From my teens I have coached within a youth sport team at a high level. This has taught me how to deal with varied levels of learning abilities and athletes with additional needs.I have always been a hands on learner and my coahcing experience and prior knowledge of construction practices and machine use has allowed me to even in highschool assist my peers and work on teaching/coaching skills by assisting my peers with their projects.</p>
                <p> My teaching experiences and coaching practices are very adaptable and focus on being easily adjustable to accomodate for multiple learners and their levels of understadnding. I have worked within the consturction industry which has given me insights into multiple different facets or careers individuals can pursure and this equips me with the knowledge to not only give them advice but also insight into industry specific practices and expectations</p>
