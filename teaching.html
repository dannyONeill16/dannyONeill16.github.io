											<h2>Core teaching values and beliefs</h2>
											<p>I strive to create an inclusive learning environments, that empower and support students of all ability levels to develop both skill proficiency and critical thinking skills.</p>
											<p>My persona when teaching is centered around being accessible, equitable and my honest and authentic self – The experiences that i give the students reflect real-world industry practices. adjusted to support diverse learners, specifically those that face difficulty when trying to use critical skills or problem solving</p>
											<p>I aim to foster the above skills through integrating project-based learning, group learning, ensuring students see themselves as capable designers, problem-solvers, and contributors to the design and furniture maker worlds </p>
											<p></p>Whether teaching year 7, 8, 9 & 10, or Stage 6 HSC classes, I encourage group discussion to build confidence and capability in both social interactions and letting them gain new insights or ways of thinking from their peers..</p>

											<p>A conecept which is at the core of my philosophy is the belief that education should equip students with skills and also the ability to apply them correctly with critical thinking, while enabling them to empower them to create an ethical and sustainable future. </p>
											<p>In my lesson i include culturally relevant examples and methods, considerations, and social and environmental awareness into my lesson and curriculum design. </p>
											<p>The goal or aim i wish to achieve is for my students to leave my classroom with knowledge, curiosity, purpose, and a strong sense of direction</p>
